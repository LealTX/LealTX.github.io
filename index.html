            <p class="mainText">A challenge is something that I do not back away from easily. I will face it head on or get defeated then go to the drawing board and figure out how to overcome the problem. My ambition for overcoming obstacles is sort of like Batman. By that I mean, the odds may be stacked against me, but I will study to find a way to beat my opponent or hop over the hurdle. A quote that I heard a while ago stuck to me, “Today I will do what others won't, so tomorrow I can accomplish what others can't”. I want to make myself better. But this doesn’t mean I don’t get bored or my days aren’t difficult.</p>
            <p class="mainText">I believe that creativity is an important outlet for the humdrum day to day, 9 to 5 American lifestyle. There are many ways to be creative from art, music and dance. But there are other slick ways to find your outlet. I love it when I find clever ways to be creative at work from creating unique forms or thinking outside of the box on an obstacle. This is something that makes the work day go by more smoothly and less monotonous. Creativity helps my ambition especially when I can involve it with something I do for work. Therefore I feel that development is a perfect route for me to go down.</p>
